				Oh hello there. Nice to know you're reading this. If we know each other, just message me, I'd love to chat! If we don't, lemme tell you a bit about myself. 
				<br />
				Coding is fun and I like learning new things. Even though I know computers, I still believe that they run on magic. My interests lie in Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics. And while I don't know much about security, I still find it fascinating. I'm always working on something or the other, and I love all things Python.
				<br />
				But enough about coding. You can check out my resume and GitHub for more information. So, what else do I do? Well, I love quizzing. Though nowadays I conduct more quizzes than I participate in. I also love reading. Mostly just fantasy with a little sci-fi peppered in. I'd mention what I'm currently reading but I don't want to update this site <span class="italic">that</span> frequently. I'm a big fan of the Wheel of Time and my IGN is inspired by that. Speaking of which, I love gaming. I usually play League of Legends, though I do love playing a bit of Civilization & X-COM. While I'm not too big on movies, I gobble up TV shows. If it has superheros, I probably watch it.
				<br />				
				But enough about me. What's up with you? Reach out to me if you have any questions or just wanna talk.
