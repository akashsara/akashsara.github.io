We developed a website and an app in order to demonstrate the proof of concept. The product functions as:</p><ol><li>A competitive environment with leaderboards, scores and badges</li><li>A social network with posts, comments and likes.</li></ol><h1 id=features>Features:</h1><ol><li><p><strong>Dynamic Communities</strong>:
A machine learning algorithm groups together users with similar psychological and fitness profiles. Community-wide tasks are issues for the users and they earn rewards upon completion. There is a community-specific leaderboard to induce further competition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Personalized Goals</strong>:
Based on the individual user profiles, we assign tasks and goals for them to achieve and reward them with points that can be redeemed for goods. A network-wide leaderboard also exists with the toppers bagging extra rewards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Virtual Reality Games</strong>:
Similar to games such as Temple Run and Subway Surfers, we developed a proof-of-concept game that involves a character running endlessly. When the user makes a jump, the character in the game will also jump. If the user mistimes his jump or does not jump, he will lose the level. This activity is tracked and is fed into the Personalized Goals module.</p></li><li><p><strong>AR Calorie Tracker</strong>:
Upon taking a photo of any food item, our app calculates a rough estimate of the calorie intake and feeds into our platform. This then utilizes this information to assign new tasks. For instance, if someone eats more than the recommended calorie intake, their tasks will involve more exercise.</p></li></ol><h1 id=my-contribution>My Contribution:</h1><p>I was fully responsible for developing the backend of the web server (using Python & Flask) and oversaw the frontend design & development. In addition, I scraped images from the internet in order to develop a custom food dataset over a combination of Indian and Western food for our AR Calorie Tracker. Attained 87% accuracy with a CNN model for identifying food items. I was also responsible for the development of Personalized Goals.</p></div></div><div class="footer wrapper"><nav class=nav><div><a href=https://github.com/hadisinaee/avicenna>Avicenna Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></nav></div><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=!1;doNotTrack||(window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)},ga.l=+new Date,ga("create","UA-137697069-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview"))</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script>
