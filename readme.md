Why do I have a separate repo for this and a separate repo for my site?

Well, Hugo is a 'static site generator'. Basically I give it a bunch of content and it does all the heavy lifting. I don't have to lose my mind over centering an element anymore :)
So this repo contains the files to actually generate my site. The generated site is available on the repo linked above. If you want to try to use/modify this particular site, you can clone this repo, download and install hugo and then simply run `hugo server -D`. This will run the site for you in your localhost. If you want to just generate the output files yourself, run `hugo -D`. That's it. Simple, no?
